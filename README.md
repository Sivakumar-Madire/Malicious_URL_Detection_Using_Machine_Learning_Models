DATASET DISCRIPTION: 
The dataset includes 11,054 entries and 32 features URL features Within data set, these headers contain binary values which indicates specific features These will help to identify is URLis phishing or legitimate.
Formally, in our data set 1 indicates phishing URLS,-1 indicates legitimate URLS, as shown in figure 2. The dataset was refined because dataset was in the form of vectors. The null values were eliminated from the dataset for preprocessing. This pre-processed dataset wasconvertedintosinglecor
pus to use for further processing. The dataset was divided in to 20percent for testing data and 80percent for training data this ratio is used to train the 6 ML models, and for the predictions and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach 20percent of the data used.
